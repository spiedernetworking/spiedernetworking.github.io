    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>There isn't much about me, but I'll try to give you some background. I started wanting to do this at the start of my freshman year of high school. Luckily I got in and unfortunately failed the class (not recommended). But it wasn't because I couldn't figure it out or it was too hard it was actually because I like doing my own thing. Freelancing was the thing for me. Creating random things, or even breaking things down that have already been developed. Coming into my sophomore year I did some work only on the coding parts (again not recommended). However, I slowly got more into javascript understanding and creating functions to do more complicated things. In my junior year I am still coding in javascript even more complicated things and now passing my third year of Computer Science. I'm also participated in N.E.I. Techfest 2024. We did not win but we did have an overall good time, it was a bit stressful a few things went wrong but congrats to Bluffton on winning. I would like to give credit to my 3-year computer science teacher and if you know you know. I am glad even with him being able to hand-select the next participants in his class I was the one chosen for three years straight. Even with my failing grades, I am so happy I could continue this path. I think my next step is using Python and getting a server. I would also like to create a local lab for myself to make sure my bounds are limitless. My current list of things to learn is Python and SQL.</p>
    <h2>About Sean</h2>
    <p>Sean is my right-hand man and troubleshooter. He and I love doing many things from band, making and listening to music, going to McDonalds, and much more. Besides being our idiot selves Sean has a bright future ahead of him. From music to his high grades he is on the path to full-on success. He has a great taste in music and we are currently working on composing a song out of scratch. Sean has always been top of his class and maintains himself very well. He is one of the most approachable and friendly people, I see him as helpful and kind. As much as he gets irritated with others the more you get to know him the better. He is a very hard worker and I have come to know him as the man who never gives up on the dream. Now and again I'm sure he needs a push but he ultimately gets the job done and that is why I'm glad to have met him.</p>
    <h2>About Future Projects</h2>
    <p>What projects can be expected in the future? Expecting nothing and everything is my true answer. Seems dumb doesn't it, but that is the full glory of being a freelance coder. You are bound to nothing but your imagination. Coding is like being the god of your world. Everything you want at the click of a button, and with a click of Ctrl + A, and Ctrl + Delete it can be destroyed. You can make the code limitless or as entrapped as you want. As the coder, all you have to worry about is making sure no errors occur. Otherwise (repeating myself) you are a god of your world all at your fingertips.</p>
    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>Throughout the fun of coding freely, I often debate if anyone will ever be able to see my work. My thing is, even if it turns out I only inspire one person to create what they want; from the next big tech company; to the next big shot freelancer, I would be happy so in the event I can I build this. Originally this site started as a Replit project beginning with the name, 'Network Killer'. Honestly, I was hoping to be the next big hacker or something like that. Now as I make my way down this path from 'Bonfire Productions', to 'Spieder Networking', I've realized I don't wish to be that person (or get in major trouble). So I worked night after night to create this simple website for others to see.</p>
    <h2>What was my own inspiration? </h2>
    <p>Well, that story falls back to middle school. During that time I had a major addiction to my console. Now I'm not proud to say I was a couch potato, a person who rarely came out to do anything but eat, shower, and go to school. Gaming was what I said was my 'hobby', but I've come to realize I was addicted to the way it felt to control everything with my controller. All actions I made changed the story and let me escape from the real world. Now most might say I did a complete 180 (not 360 or you are still facing the same way). I am more interactive and not always trying to escape life as I often would. During all of this gaming, I wanted the power of a real game that was made for me. So I searched and wouldn't you know it coding was the primary start to that.</p>
    <h2>With all of this what is my major goal?</h2>
    <p>Well, I've asked myself the same question. Why do this with the chance no one notices? Well if I made this up on the spot or not the answer is because even if no one else notices my work I still want to see my progress. A visual of where I started to where I can go in the future.</p>
    <h2>What should be your first steps?</h2>
    <p>Even though I am not a complete expert I do want to say my peace on this. Start by asking yourself, 'Why and what do I want to do this for?' In all honesty, your answer probably won't match mine, but in the end that's not the point of the question. The point is to find your reason and encouragement to go down this path. Once you have found that out ask yourself again after a while. Your answer may very well change just like my own. It may be because it's fun or maybe it is because you found a hidden talent with it, but either way, ask yourself why every once in a while to keep your encouragement in mind at all times.</p>
    <h2>Northeast Indiana Techfest 2024</h2>
    <p>From my expierence with Techfest I have had a good time. Techfest was lively with many supporting companies. Ivy Tech being the host and many volunteers there to help and guide others. I participated with a friend Sean, and as close as we were to third place we were outclassed by cheaters. We were allowed to use AI and ChatGPT to help code it, but me and Sean did it via pure skill. I'm not a very competitive coder however it was more of a relaxed event when doing the computer science and coding competition.</p>
